This repository contains files regarding the project 'Semantic Text Segment Classification on Structured Technical Content'. You can find the postprocessed training, validation and test sets. Upon request, we are also happy to provide the XML file containing all data before preprocessing. It comes with a preprocessing Python module, which you can adapt to your needs.
