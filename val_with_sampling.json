During this meeting, Laura helps Catherine to define a company profile for Akron with basic contact information, and specify the countries and industries that Akron operates in. Laura schedules a scoping workshop with Catherine. A small group of Akron employees representing different areas of the company also attend the session. They begin by confirming the decisions that Catherine made about the country and business type. Next, Laura takes a few minutes to introduce the idea of the catalog to the group. She explains that the system has already determined and highlighted the relevant business areas, packages, and topics from the catalog, based on their country and business type. At this point, they review and verify these preselections, making some adjustments. When they have finalized the business areas, packages, and topics, they move on to the list of preselected business options. Laura explains that SAP has already defined the technical system settings that are needed to accommodate each business option. All that Catherine and her team have to do is review the preselected business options and answer the corresponding questions. To make things even easier, Laura informs the group that they can simply decide to accept SAP recommendations and skip straight to the results, without reviewing each individual business option. These recommendations are based on industry-specific best practices, developed from the knowledge and experience that SAP, along with its partners and customers, has acquired over the years. Catherine chooses to accept the recommendations. The results provide Catherine and her team with a summary of the decisions made to-date that can be used as the basis for an initial proposal.","11658":"SSL properties set on the Java Virtual Machine take precedence over the SSL properties set in this file.","17652":"Column filters are not applied when detecting row counts.","19558":"When replicating a generic article, you must replicate all corresponding variants.
